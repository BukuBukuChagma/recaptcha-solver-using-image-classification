# Google ReCaptcha-v2 Solver

This project was a test to see if Image Classification can beat the results of Object Detection in solving Google ReCaptcha-v2. Unfortunately Image Classifcation didn't produce very good results, so that concludes that Object Detection should be the way to go for these kind of tasks.

To test this project, follow the instructions below:
1. Download the model from Google Drive and place it in the same directory. 
   Google Drive link for model : https://drive.google.com/file/d/13XPTlzM6Q2l69RehA8G5sHbhsAPbcO6p/view?usp=share_link

2. Download Google Chrome Beta, you can download it from here : https://www.google.com/intl/en_pk/chrome/beta/

3. Lastly you also need Chrome Driver for the version of Chrome Beta you are using. If latest version of chrome beta, then just download latest version of chrome driver.
   Link for chrome driver : https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
   
   You need to place this chrome driver in the same directory also.

NOW YOU ARE GOOD TO GO!!
Just run the main.py to test the project.
